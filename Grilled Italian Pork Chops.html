<h2>Discription</h2>
<p>
  Grilled pork chops covered with ham, tomato and mozzarella cheese.
</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>4 (3/4 inch thick) pork chops</li>
  <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
  <li>4 slices ham</li>
  <li>4 slices tomato</li>
  <li>4 slices mozzarella cheese</li>
  <li>chopped fresh oregano to taste</li>
  <li>paprika to taste</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sprinkle pork chops with salt and black pepper, and grill until the chops are browned, show good grill marks, and are no longer pink in the middle, 5 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
  </li>
  <li>
    Place ham, tomato, and mozzarella cheese slices on each pork chop, and sprinkle with oregano and paprika; cook until the cheese has melted, about 2 more minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
